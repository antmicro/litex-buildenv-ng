# LiteX BuildEnv NG (working title)

This project is intended to supersede [the original LiteX BuildEnv](https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv).

Presently called “LiteX BuildEnv NG”, it is aimed to be multiplatform, more Pythonic and solve some other issues which became apparent throughout the lifetime of LBE.

The tool can be used in a similar way to the original LiteX BuildEnv: to prepare a shell environment the user has to source the `./bootstrap.sh` script, providing relevant CLI parameters or using the configuration file.

More documentation is obviously on its way.
