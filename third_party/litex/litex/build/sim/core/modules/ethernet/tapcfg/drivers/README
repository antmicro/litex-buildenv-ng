Notice about the contents
-------------------------

This directory contains the source code for 3rd party device drivers. All
drivers should be updated to the latest versions as of 2009-02-25, and because
the development seems to be quite slow, it is unlikely that there will be big
changes in them. However I will try to keep them up to date and update this file
as well when necessary.

These drivers are crucial for tapcfg to work, so it's safer to keep them all in
one place. However they are not made or updated by me unless otherwise noted.
All questions and comments can be sent to the original authors.
