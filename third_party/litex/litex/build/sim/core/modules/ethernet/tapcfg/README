Notes about using the library on different systems:
---------------------------------------------------

Linux:

Should work when ran as root without problems.

The interface name is not defined in any way and can be any alphanumeric name.
Automatically allocated device names are in format tapX.

Windows:

Requires TAP-Win32 driver installed, can be downloaded for example from
http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/ location. The version tap901 is tested and
recommended.

The interface name can be basically anything, but it is fixed and can be
changed from the control panel by the user.

Mac OS X:

Requires TunTap driver for the Mac OS X system. Can be downloaded from
http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/ location.

The interface name is always in format tapX and maps to '/dev/tapX'.

FreeBSD:

Requires that the TAP driver is loaded to the system. This can usually be done
by running the command "kldload if_tap" as root.

The interface name is always in format tapX and maps to '/dev/tapX'.

NetBSD:

Should work when ran as root without problems.

The interface name is always in format tapX and maps to '/dev/tapX'. However
the interface needs to be first created with 'ifconfig <ifname> create'.
If an automatically created interface is wanted the interface name 'tap'
should be used, system will map it to an available tapX interface
automatically.

Solaris:

Requires that TAP driver is installed to the system. It can be downloaded from
http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/ or installed using pkg-get with the
command "pkg-get install tap".

The interface name is always in format tapX.


On all systems if the fallback flag is defined on TAP interface startup, an
available legal TAP device is automatically searched and used on all systems,
even if the defined interface is not available. It is recommended to use the
fallback option for portability, because each system has slightly different
naming conventions.
